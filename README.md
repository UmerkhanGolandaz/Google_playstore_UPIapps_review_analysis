# Machine Learning for Customer Experience in Financial Services (Capstone Project) 2024

## Overview

This project analyzes customer sentiment expressed in Google Play Store reviews of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) apps using a **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** pre-trained model. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to gain insights into customer opinions and perceptions regarding the product or services offered by these apps in the financial sector.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Customer reviews were scraped from the Google Play Store using the `google-play-scraper` package to create a dataset for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using the pre-trained **BERT** model to classify the sentiment of each review into categories (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key insights and sentiment trends from the customer feedback using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- **Customer Feedback Insights**: The project provides insights into how customers perceive various features and services of UPI apps, including security, ease of use, and reliability.
